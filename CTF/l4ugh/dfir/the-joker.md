> [!NOTE] DESCRIPTION
> The Joker has struck again, targeting Wayne Enterprises with a devious blackmail scheme. He claims to have stolen sensitive proprietary data and is demanding a massive payout in exchange for his silence. To make matters worse, he’s hinted that if his demands aren’t met, Gotham’s criminals will gain access to the secrets, plunging the city into chaos. Suspicion falls on Dr. Jonathan Crane, a leading scientist in Wayne Enterprises’ research division. Known for his work in experimental psychology and chemical research, Crane has always walked a fine line between groundbreaking innovation and unsettling obsession. Despite his denial of involvement, the Joker’s taunts suggest an inside job—or something even more sinister as some of his work overlaps with the stolen data. Acting on Lucius Fox’s advice, a memory dump was captured from Crane’s workstation during a critical window. Now it’s up to you to analyze the dump and uncover the truth. Did the Joker use malware to infiltrate the system? Was Crane coerced into betraying Wayne Enterprises? Or is there another dark twist waiting to be revealed? Gotham’s future rests on your ability to find the answers.

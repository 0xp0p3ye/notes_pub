**SSRF hacktricks:**

#### blacklist-based input filters

- Use an alternative IP representation of `127.0.0.1`, such as `2130706433`, `017700000001`, or `127.1`.
- Register your own domain name that resolves to `127.0.0.1`. You can use `spoofed.burpcollaborator.net` for this purpose.
- Obfuscate blocked strings using URL encoding or case variation.
- Provide a URL that you control, which redirects to the target URL. Try using different redirect codes, as well as different protocols for the target URL. For example, switching from an `http:` to `https:` URL during the redirect has been shown to bypass some anti-SSRF filters.
 
** lab:**

`stockApi=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%2Fadmin` did not work

trying `localhost` --> `127.0.0.1` & `127.1`

`stockApi=http%3A%2F%2F127.0.0.1%2Fadmin`
`stockApi=http%3A%2F%2F127.1%2Fadmin`

trying double URL encoding for admin path

`stockApi=http%3A%2F%2F127.1%2F%2561%2564%256d%2569%256e`

`stockApi=http%3A%2F%2F127.1%2F%2561%2564%256d%2569%256e`

- double encoding worked `localhost` --> `127.1`   |    `admin` --> `%2561%2564%256d%2569%256e`

#### whitelist-based input filters


- You can embed credentials in a URL before the hostname, using the `@` character. For example:
    `https://expected-host:fakepassword@evil-host`
- You can use the `#` character to indicate a URL fragment. For example:
    `https://evil-host#expected-host`
- You can leverage the DNS naming hierarchy to place required input into a fully-qualified DNS name that you control. For example:
    `https://expected-host.evil-host`
- You can URL-encode characters to confuse the URL-parsing code. This is particularly useful if the code that implements the filter handles URL-encoded characters differently than the code that performs the back-end HTTP request. You can also try [double-encoding](https://portswigger.net/web-security/essential-skills/obfuscating-attacks-using-encodings#obfuscation-via-double-url-encoding) characters; some servers recursively URL-decode the input they receive, which can lead to further discrepancies.
- You can use combinations of these techniques together.

```
http://localhost#@stock.weliketoshop.net/admin
```

- The `#` appears between `localhost` and `@stock.weliketoshop.net/admin`, which is unusual. The fragment identifier typically follows the domain, but `localhost#` would make the rest of the URL after `#` be treated as part of the fragment (i.e., the server and path after `#` might not be recognized as part of the URL at all).

#### Whatâ€™s likely happening here:

- **Malformed URL**: The `#` symbol is causing the part after it to be treated as a **fragment**, meaning the `@stock.weliketoshop.net/admin` part would be ignored by the server and instead processed client-side as a fragment identifier.
- **The `@` symbol**: If there was supposed to be authentication info (username and password), this part would typically go before the `@` symbol, but it's not formatted properly.





Now instead of fetching the URL directly we may also utilize the redirect option if one if available

`/product/nextProduct?currentProductId=6&path=http://evil-user.net`
